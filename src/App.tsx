        <h1>So what's the issue?</h1>
        <p>
          Hey there, welcome to our spot on the web where we're diving deep into
          the issue of diversity in the IT world! Over the past few years,
          information technology has exploded, becoming a major force driving
          innovation and change. But here's the thing: even though women and
          folks of color have been rocking it in IT, there's still a big lack of
          diversity in many areas.
        </p>
        <p>
          This lack of diversity isn't just a bummer for the individuals who
          aren't representedâ€”it's a big deal for the whole industry. That's why
          our website is here! We're all about sharing info and resources on
          this super important topic. Plus, we want to get the conversation
          going and spur some action towards making the IT world a more diverse
          and inclusive place.
        </p>
        <p>
          So, take a look around, dive into the discussions, and let's team up
          to make the future of IT fairer and more awesome for everyone. Glad to
          have you here!

      <section id="why" className="section-2">
        <h1>But why is this a problem?</h1>
        <p>
          When the IT industry lacks diversity, it can cause some serious
          problems. Check it out:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <h2>Limited Perspectives</h2>
            <p>
              When everyone in a certain profession comes from similar
              backgrounds, they might not think of all the different ways people
              might use technology. This means we could miss out on cool new
              ideas and inventions that could help everyone.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h2>Bias in Technology</h2>
            <p>
              Ever heard the saying "garbage in, garbage out"? Well, it's true
              for tech too! Sometimes, the people who make technology don't
              think about everyone who might use it. For example, facial
              recognition software might not work as well for people with darker
              skin tones, which could lead to some pretty bad situations.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h2>Underrepresentation of Customers</h2>
            <p>
              If the people making tech don't look like the people using it,
              they might not make stuff that works for everyone. This means some
              people could miss out on cool tech that could make their lives
              easier.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h2>Limited Opportunities</h2>
            <p>
              When there's not enough diversity in the IT world, it's harder for
              people from different backgrounds to get in on the action. That
              means some really smart and talented people might not get the
              chance to shine.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h2>Negative Impacts on Society</h2>
            <p>
              Tech has a huge impact on how we live our lives, and when it's not
              made with everyone in mind, it can make things worse. Biased tech
              can make unfairness and inequality even worse in our society.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          To fix these problems, we need to make sure the IT world looks more
          like the real world. That means doing things like training people on
          diversity and inclusion, reaching out to groups that don't have as
          much representation, and making workplaces more welcoming to everyone.

            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h2>Speak Up for Yourself</h2>
            <p>
              Your voice matters! Don't be afraid to toot your own horn and
              advocate for your skills and achievements. Whether it's
              negotiating your salary, taking on challenging projects, or
              pushing for more training opportunities, own your worth and go
              after what you deserve!
            </p>

            <h2>Fight Bias Like a Boss</h2>

              Unfortunately, bias can rear its ugly head in the workplace. But
              fear not, you've got the power to combat it! Speak out against any
              unfair treatment, get involved in diversity initiatives, and
              champion a more inclusive workplace culture. Together, we can make
              waves and create a more equitable tech world!
