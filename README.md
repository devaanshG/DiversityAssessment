# How to run

In order to run the website, you will need to have npm installed on your machine.

Once installed, follow these steps to get the development server running on your machine:

- Download the code or clone this repository.
- Navigate to the 'assessment' folder
- Run the following commands

```
npm i
npm run dev
```

- From there, follow the instructions in the command line (it'll display the port on which the dev server is running, from which you can see the website)
